The code is very easy to run. To run a question, simply set the variable corresponding to it (Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5) = True and run the code and the results will be printed. For Q5 the shape parameter and number of iterations may be changed as the last 2 inputs to the orthogonalmatching function, respectively.
